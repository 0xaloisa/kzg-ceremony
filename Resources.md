# Summary

The KZG Ceremony is an Ethereum project which will provide a cryptographic foundation for scaling initiatives like EIP-4844: Proto-Danksharding. The Ceremony is a coordinated public ritual (aka trusted setup, "Parameter Generation Event" in Zcash) which is expected to have the following characteristics:

- wide ecosystem participation
- accessible: possible to participate via browser
- a meaningful narrative in a simple interface 
- easy to audit transcript
